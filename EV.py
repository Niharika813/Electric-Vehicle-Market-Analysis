# In[4]:

#Introduction
'''The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly increasing as governments, industries, and consumers shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation. Understanding the trends in EV title and registration activities is crucial for policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure planners. This case study leverages data from Data.gov, specifically focusing on electric vehicle title and registration activities across US region. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into the growth patterns, regional distribution, and demographic factors influencing the adoption of electric vehicles. By exploring this dataset, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of electric mobility and its implications for the future.'''
#My goal was to forecast the electric vehicle (EV) market growth over the next five years using this data. This prediction will enable manufacturers and infrastructure planners to allocate resources effectively and develop targeted marketing strategies, with the aim of boosting EV registrations in regions where adoption is currently low.

#Ask Phase
#This analysis focuses on leveraging electric vehicle (EV) title and registration data to forecast market growth and guide strategic decisions. The primary goal is to extract valuable insights into EV adoption trends, regional distribution, and consumer preferences. By identifying key patterns and growth opportunities in the EV market, I aim to provide actionable recommendations for manufacturers and infrastructure planners, ensuring their strategies align with current and future market demands.
#The 4 key Business Tasks:

'''1. Analyze EV Adoption Over Time:

Examine historical data to assess the growth trends of electric vehicle (EV) registrations by model year. Identify patterns and shifts in adoption rates over different years to forecast future growth.

2. Assess Geographical Distribution:

Map the distribution of EV registrations by geographic regions (e.g., counties or cities) to understand regional adoption rates. Determine which areas have higher concentrations of EVs and identify regions with potential for growth.

3. Categorize EV Types:

Break down the dataset by electric vehicle types (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)) to understand the market share of different EV categories. Analyze trends in consumer preferences for specific types of EVs.

4. Evaluate Make and Model Popularity:

Identify the most popular makes and models of electric vehicles from the registration data. Determine which manufacturers and models are leading in the market and how their popularity has evolved over time.

5. Analyze Electric Range:

Assess the electric range of various EV models to gauge advancements in EV technology. Analyze how improvements in range are influencing consumer choices and market dynamics.

6. Estimate Growth in Market Size:

Calculate the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles based on historical data and current trends. Develop forecasts for future market expansion and identify key drivers of growth.'''

#Data Source
#For this analysis, I used the public dataset "Electric_Vehicle_Title_and_Registration_Activity" available on DATA.GOV, which contains 1,079,230 records. The dataset includes information such as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Type, DOL Vehicle Type, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Range, County, City, Sales Date, and Sales Price. These data points provide a comprehensive view of electric vehicle registrations and characteristics, offering valuable insights to inform market growth forecasts and strategic planning for the EV industry.
